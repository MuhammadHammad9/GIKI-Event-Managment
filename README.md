# GIKI-Event-Managment

Introduction:
Organizing university events can be exciting, but it often comes with a lot of challenges like from handling ticket bookings to managing venues and keeping everything on schedule. To make things easier, we developed a Ticketing Management System (TMS) aimed at simplifying how student clubs and societies plan and manage their events.

Picture a campus filled with active clubs, each hosting different types of events. Without a centralized system, managing these can get messy. That’s where TMS comes in. It acts like a smart helper that brings everything together like event planning, ticketing, guest lists, venue management, and even payment handling.

One of the biggest benefits of TMS is how user-friendly it is. Whether it's booking tickets, updating event details, or cancelling plans, everything can be done quickly and easily. The system also includes secure payment options, so students and organizers don’t have to worry about safety when handling transactions.

Behind the scenes, TMS is built with features to make sure events don’t exceed capacity, and all data stays accurate and consistent. It’s a big step up from using scattered tools or doing things manually.

In short, this system is designed to save time, reduce stress, and improve how events are managed on campus. It’s not just a tool, it’s a better way to bring student-led events to life.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Planning and managing university events often involves outdated methods that can lead to confusion, errors, and unnecessary stress for both organizers and attendees. The Ticketing Management System (TMS) aims to solve several major issues commonly faced in traditional event setups.

One of the main problems is the lack of efficiency in managing event logistics. Paper-based ticketing, manual spreadsheets, and last-minute coordination often result in errors, delays, and miscommunication. By digitizing these tasks, TMS reduces the chances of things slipping through the cracks and helps keep everything organized from start to finish, including tasks like handling registration desks.

Another challenge is the limited and sometimes frustrating booking process. When tickets are sold manually by society members, at on-campus cafés, or through informal means, the experience can feel unorganized or unclear to attendees. There’s also the risk of overbooking or losing track of ticket sales. TMS tackles this with a user-friendly interface and clear, automated features that make booking smooth and transparent for everyone.

To summarize, TMS directly addresses the following problems:

Inefficient Event Management: Manual processes like paper-based systems and spreadsheets are slow, error-prone, and hard to coordinate.

Poor Booking Experience: Traditional ticket sales methods often lack convenience, clarity, and flexibility for both organizers and attendees.

By offering a modern, all-in-one platform, the Ticketing Management System brings structure, speed, and simplicity to campus event planning.
